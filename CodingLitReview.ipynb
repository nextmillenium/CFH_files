This was a rather revolutionary idea compared to the traditional Close Reading, which focuses on the thorough interpretation of an individual work. Both reading techniques are the prior means of Visual Text Analysis. We present an overview of the research conducted since 2005 on supporting text analysis tasks with close and distant reading visualizations in the digital humanities. Therefore, we classify the observed papers according to a taxonomy of text analysis tasks, categorize applied close and distant reading techniques to support the investigation of these tasks and illustrate approaches that combine both reading techniques in order to provide a multi‐faceted view of the textual data. In addition, we take a look at the used text sources and at the typical data transformation steps required for the proposed visualizations. Finally, we summarize collaboration experiences when developing visualizations for close and distant reading, and we give an outlook on future challenges in that research area.\\nIn 2005, Franco Moretti introduced Distant Reading to analyse entire literary text collections.

Both reading techniques are the prior means of Visual Text Analysis. We present an overview of the research conducted since 2005 on supporting text analysis tasks with close and distant reading visualizations in the digital humanities.', 'Unknown', 'This article seeks to define Digital Theology, first by exploring the development of the CODEC Research Centre at Durham University – perhaps the only centre developed to explore Digital Theology. The aims of the centre and some of its projects are explored leading to a discussion of CODEC’s place within Digital Humanities. The article concludes with a focus on different aspects and definitions of Digital Theology.', 'Purpose The purpose of this paper is to conduct a retrospective bibliometric analysis of documents about digital humanities, an emerging but interdisciplinary movement. It examines the distribution of research outputs and languages, identifies the active journals and institutions, dissects the network of categories and cited references, and interprets the hot research topics. Design/methodology/approach The source data are derived from the Web of Science (WoS) core collection. To reveal the holistic landscape of this field, VOSviewer and CiteSpace as popular visualization tools are employed to process the bibliographic data including author, category, reference, and keyword. Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis. Findings There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science. Research limitations/implications This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain. Originality/value The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.', \"Self-regulation is of interest both to psychologists and to teachers. But what the word means is unclear. To define it precisely, two studies examined the American Psychological Association's system of controlled vocabulary—specifically, the 447 associated terms it presents—and used techniques from the Digital Humanities to identify 88 closely related concepts and six broad conceptual clusters. The resulting analyses show how similar ideas are interrelated: self-control, self-management, self-observation, learning, social behavior, and the personality constructs related to self-monitoring. A full-color network map locates these concepts and clusters relative to each other. It also highlights some of the interests of different audiences, which can be described heuristically using two axes that have been labeled abstract versus practical and self-oriented versus other-oriented.\", 'Unknown', 'Presents a Chinese ancient books digital humanities research platform (CABDHRP) to support historical China studies, one which provides two novel functions that can more effectively support digital humanities research, including an automatic text annotation system (ATAS) for interpreting texts and a character social network relationship map tool (CSNRMT) for exploring characters’ social network relationships.

We identify two major developments that seem to be taking place within DH, with a specific focus on the infrastructural aspects of the development: (1) a strive to open up and broaden the research output and (2) multi-disciplinary collaboration and its effects. The two major components accentuate the new infrastructural patterns that are developing and the challenges these infer on universities. While current research is at large multi-disciplinary, developing infrastructures also enable the move towards post-disciplinarity, bringing the universities closer to the surrounding society. At five universities in Sweden, individual-sited infrastructures supporting DH research have been built today. They are complemented by national and international infrastructures, thus supporting developments and tackling some of the major challenges. In the article, the relations between individual disciplines, the question of multi- and post-disciplinarity, and the field of Digital Humanities are discussed, while stressing the factors necessary—sine qua non—for a fruitful development of the scholarly infrastructures.', 'Digital humanities are often described in terms of humanistic work being carried out with the aid of digital tools, usually computer-based [...]', 'Unknown', 'This article argues that the primary role of the instructor is to help students understand and work with the difficult emotional states that arise from struggling to learn. Drawing on Sianne Ngai’s theorization of “ugly feelings” and using his own experience with digital humanities instruction as a case study, the author offers ways to center emotional work, especially work involving frustration and anxiety, in the classroom. Asking students to develop failed prototypes and reflect on the process, for example, can provide them with a better sense of what it might mean to succeed. Giving the same exercise twice, with artificially imposed difficulties the second time, might help them learn concrete steps for working through mounting irritation. In short, frustration and anxiety are not things that emerge from time to time—they are ever-present. The author argues that it is the job of instructors to develop ways to prepare students not for the unexpected failure but for the inevitable frustration that comes even with success.', 'This article presents the findings of a web survey designed to better understand the expectations and use of digital editions of texts. The survey, modelled upon a detailed analysis of 242 projects, recorded 218 complete responses, shedding light on user requirements of digital editions. Specifically, the survey indicates that issues of data reuse, licensing, image availability, and comprehensive documentation are the most requested features of digital editions, although ones which seldom are provided. This analysis feeds into previous studies on good practice in building Digital Humanities resources and puts forward practical recommendations for both creators and funders of digital editions in an effort to promote a stronger consideration of user needs. This survey will be of interest to those who produce digital editions of texts, including developers and engineers, and will also be of interest to those who commission and fund these projects, such as universities, libraries, and archives, whose documentary collections are often showcased in digital editions.', 'Unknown', 'Abstract Higher education operates in a quickly changing, progressively more globalized, cosmopolitan, and interconnected world (Bauman, 2000, Globalization: The Human Consequences. New York/Chichester: Columbia University Press; Appiah, 2006, Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers. New York: W.W. Norton & Co; Zuckerman, 2013, Rewire: Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection. New York: W. W. Norton & Company). At the same time, substantive inequalities between people and places mean that this connectivity and knowledge is unevenly spread (Hallberg Adu, 2014, What is the opposite of a knowledge society? A critical reflection from Ghana. In Amoah, L. (ed.), Impacts of the Knowledge Society on Economic and Social Growth in Africa. IGI Global). For our students, the future leaders of this unequal world, critical reasoning becomes a key skill, and perhaps especially so for students in the Global South. This paper argues that digital humanities (DH) can provide both a theoretical framework for decolonizing the academy and technological solutions to hurdles in this process. The paper argues that assignments, their theoretical underpinnings, and implementation are key to decolonizing higher education. It describes three accessible technology-driven assignments with DH pedagogy created for diverse classrooms at Ashesi University in Ghana and discusses their outcomes.', 'PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the task design and assignment of full-text generation on mass Chinese historical archives (CHAs) by crowdsourcing, with special attention paid to how to best divide full-text generation tasks into smaller ones assigned to crowdsourced volunteers and to improve the digitization of mass CHAs and the data-oriented processing of the digital humanities.Design/methodology/approachThis paper starts from the complexities of character recognition of mass CHAs, takes Sheng Xuanhuai archives crowdsourcing project of Shanghai Library as a case study, and makes use of the theories of archival science, including diplomatics of Chinese archival documents, and the historical approach of Chinese archival traditions as the theoretical basis and analysis methods. The results are generated through the comprehensive research.FindingsThis paper points out that volunteer tasks of full-text generation include transcription, punctuation, proofreading, metadata description, segmentation, and attribute annotation in digital humanities and provides a metadata element set for volunteers to use in creating or revising metadata descriptions and also provides an attribute tag set. The two sets can be used across the humanities to construct overall observations about texts and the archives of which they are a part. Along these lines, this paper presents significant insights for application in outlining the principles, methods, activities, and procedures of crowdsourced full-text generation for mass CHAs.Originality/valueThis study is the first to explore and identify the effective design and allocation of tasks for crowdsourced volunteers completing full-text generation on CHAs in digital humanities.', 'The scholarly field of the digital humanities has recently expanded and integrated its fundamental concepts, historical coverage, relationship to social experience, scale of projects, and range of interpretive approaches. All this brings the overall field (including the related area of new media studies) to a tipping point where it has the potential not just to facilitate the work of the humanities but to represent the state of the humanities at large in its changing relation to higher education in the postindustrial state. Are the digital humanities up to this larger task?', 'Unknown', 'The following case study describes two library-led text encoding projects involving correspondence collections. The first, a documentary edition of personal papers held by Peter Still, a former slave, was conceived as an independent research project involving the participation of two undergraduate research assistants; the second, based upon letters to and from the Rutgers College War Service Bureau (1917–1919), has been designed as a two-week text encoding unit in a proposed undergraduate course on data and culture. These two projects, both featuring the letter as their object of study, are compared and contrasted as models of data and process, affording reflections on the overlapping concerns of the library instruction and digital humanities communities of practice. I propose viewing text encoding projects, particularly those that focus on lesser known creators or on life documents such as letters, as a means of accessing both critical library pedagogy and digital humanities methodology. By developing such projects, librarians address a number of collection and instruction related objectives of the library, while offering a valuable introduction to a set of methods that are of increasing importance to undergraduate education. Furthermore, these projects may be conducted at smaller scales, by reusing and adapting methods and software shared by the digital humanities community, thereby limiting reliance on institutional partners for technology and infrastructure support, which may not be forthcoming in under-resourced institutional contexts.', 'Unknown', \"Researchers whose work requires intimacy with the in-betweenness of digital data may find that screenshots offer an edge of simplicity over application programming interfaces (APIs) for collecting, storing, filing, and retrieving proof of online utterances. While Web-scraping tools allow the most technologically inclined among us to make (relatively) quick and quantitatively thorough sweeps of online information, their function can be easily nullified by a few changes in the code. This is a difficult truth the author learned while trying to supplement my dissertation data a year after my defense, when Twitter restricted access to its firehose, killing services like Topsy, a social-media search engine that allowed users to retrieve historical tweets from the platform, bypassing the time limits of Twitters basic API. Screenshots like their analog predecessors, photographs capture a momentary truth. Granted, both are shot through with complexities. Despite what users are able to capture by pressing a few keys, the images produced can be subject to internal and external manipulation. Among their other frailties, screenshots and pictures are subject to the shooter's aperture and how much of the information horizon their creator cares to include.\", 'At the heart of the Digital Humanities discourse in postcolonial information societies like India is a subject that is marked by connectivity and access. The discourse and practice put forward a very explicit imagination of a connected subject that is also naturalized in digital humanities. The intended beneficiary is posited as \"to be connected,\" entering a curative cycle of literacy and access intended to reform this subject. This paper proposes a subject of \"disconnectivity,\" which needs to be introduced into this debate. In the face of Internet blackouts and online bans, there is a subject who gets disconnected when it has potential for dissent or critique. Drawing from 1000 responses gathered in the wake of a political agitation in the city of Ahmedabad, I sketch the new paradoxes of the disconnected subject. It offers a critique of the tropes of access, presence, inclusion, and participation to show how digital humanities in South Asia needs a more critical investment in imagining its subjects as it takes on the politics of preservation, memory, and archiving.', 'This issue of VIEW provides a critical survey of new digital humanities (DH) methods and tools directed toward audiovisual (AV) media. DH as a field is still dominated by a focus on textual studies (studies of word culture) that are largely “deaf and blind” in their capacity to search, discover, and study AV materials. The mandate to improve these capacities is clear and unquestioned, though the pathways are fecund and numerous. New and emergent tools related to deep learning algorithms are reasonably expected to change this methodological landscape within the digitally accelerated near-future.', 'Unknown', 'The International Tracing Service archives offer process-generated documents from resettlement programs for displaced persons (DP) after World War II. This paper addresses two key challenges to ongoing research based on those archival holdings: the generation of data; and the visual representation of that data in geographic information systems. Digital history offers the opportunity to go beyond case studies and use the wealth of process-generated documents as serial sources for algorithm-based analysis. However, data in that form does not exist as such, and thus needs to be generated – a process that implies interpretative acts such as abstraction, normalization, and trans-coding, which are shaped by the character of digital media. Can modeling a DP’s life into a series of events, and digitally processing the resultant data, help to find out more about the agency of DPs negotiating their destiny with the authorities? If the mostly hidden and implicit configurations of digital knowledge production are thoughtfully considered and geostatistical analysis is combined with close readings of selected source documents, hermeneutic and quantitative approaches can be reconciled via digital history. This mixed method approach has implications for research culture and the publication of such data.', \"While the term “digital humanities” appears inclusive, its exact meaning remains unclear and its early association with studies in English Literature means the term has already been partially superceded by “digital methods.” However, that renaming is problematic as it emphasises the research tools used while the field itself is adjusting to include new methods, new topics, and new types of production, not just new ways of working with existing materials. Historians have long been alert to new tools as they become available to researchers. However, even as historians have revelled in the increased access to primary sources provided by digitisation and have analysed the opportunities that access offers, they have been aware of the unevenness of the digitisation process and the gaps it both creates and disguises. Issues of copyright and the ethics of creating public access to private lives have also caused historians concern. More recently, discussion about the evaluation of digital scholarship has begun. Often purely digital outputs are not formally recognised by their authors' institutions, despite having a significant online presence and contributing to scholarship. In parallel with being concerned about fairly assessing the work of peers, historians have also begun to consider how to teach (and assess) the digital skills now expected of history graduates.\", 'Unknown', 'Endeavour to Dive This essay reflects the thinking that I am doing as a scholar and practitioner who moves between performance studies and digital humanities, and digital media studies, all refracted through a kaleidoscopic critical lens that focuses and multiplies my understandings, priorities, and accountabilities toward work that is anti-colonial, trans- feminist and queer\\'ing, crip\\'ing, and anti-racist. Run with Whatever You Can Carry The vast majority of scholars in both performance studies and digital humanities will continue to try to distinguish themselves in these fields while applying term-by-term to teach in various adjunct faculty positions, launching themselves at whichever courses in whatever disciplines they can find work in, getting paid a nonliving wage unless they manage to accumulate a teaching load massive enough that they make enough money to live, at which point we need to add to all disciplinary methods, the method of doing research in structurally impossible circumstances. When Blinded, Construct Images around Unknown Sounds and Assume You Are Correct In the mid-1990s many performance studies and theater journals published special issues on the topics of digitality, the internet, computing theater, embodiment, and documentation.6 The one to which I am particularly attached is the \"Performing the Digital Body\" special issue of Women & Performance, edited by Theresa Senft.7 It was issue 9.1. Throughout this four-hour event, the performance was documented by the over one hundred people in attendance with their media of choice: some recording video on cell phones, others live sketching, another through an improvised DJ set, others still through video cameras, mini-tape audio recording, stenography machine, instant Polaroid and other film-based photography, live journaling, live tweeting, perpetual Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat posts.', 'Taking as self-evident that the “dark side” under discussion is a discursive construct of the digital humanities rather than “actually existing projects” (a clarifying phrase taken from Rita Raley’s post-\\ncomments), this essay suggests that the construct is too often indulged at the expense of dedicated critiques of digital humanities’ projects, as well as its papers, publications, syllabi, and so forth. We inhabit the construct when we forego these normative products of academic labor in favor of the terrible things in the title of this article, things that are said nearly daily on blogs, lists, and Twitter: Digital humanities is a nest of big data ideologues. Like Johnny, digital humanities won’t read. Digital humanities doesn’t do theory. Digital humanities\\nhistoricizes. Digital humanities doesn’t do race, class, gender, or, for that matter, culture. Digital humanities is complicit. Digital humanities is a neoliberalist contrivance for dismantling the professoriate. Digital humanities is the academic import of Silicon Valley solutionism. Perhaps most damning of all: digital humanities is something separate from the rest of the humanities, and—this is the real secret—digital humanities\\nit that way. Yet the zero-sum\\nof the construct seems itself complicit in a worldview that is neoliberal, ahistorical, and unconcerned with the materialities of contemporary scholarly production. Sometimes, and not incidentally, the construct can even resemble the virtualized Kung Fu arena of the\\nthat was called by the same name. This essay, the third of what has become an unplanned trilogy, explains why.', 'Purpose\\n– Digital humanities (DH) has become a much discussed topic among both humanities scholars and library professionals. The library and information science (LIS) community has taken efforts in providing new facilities and developing new services to meet humanities scholars’ changing research behaviors and needs employing digital tools and methods. How to effectively collaborate with the DH community has been a challenging task to LIS in their digital library (DL) development endeavors. The purpose of this paper is to discover productive ways for LIS to support DH scholarship, specifically, what DL components, including content, technology, and service, should and could be developed for digital humanists.\\nDesign/methodology/approach\\n– As an initial effort of the Digital Humanities Interest Group at University of California, Irvine Libraries, the examination is primarily based on a cross-boundary environmental scan in both DH and DL fields. The environmental survey includes both a literature review and web and physical site visits. The survey results, especially a gap analysis between the behaviors and needs of humanities scholars and the digital content, technologies, and services currently offered by the DL community, are used to shape the proposed roles of DH librarianship.\\nFindings\\n– First, DH’s innovative approach to research and teaching practices brings opportunities and challenges. Second, DH research is collaborative work. Third, major channels are established for the DH community. Fourth, various tools and data sets are developed to support different types of projects. Fifth, DH community has unbalanced geographical and disciplinary distribution. Sixth, DH research output still lacks attention, integration, and sustainability. Finally, LIS professionals play unique roles in DH projects. Overall, the communities of DH and DL share common goals and tasks.\\nPractical implications\\n– This paper proposes these present and future roles of LIS professionals: creator and contributor; curator; messenger and liaison; educator; mediator and interpreter; host; partner; innovator; “hybrid scholar”; advocate; consultant. At the organizational level, libraries should demonstrate higher efficiency and effectiveness in the services by revamping organizational culture or structure to stimulate and realize more and deeper cross-boundary conversations and collaborations. On a larger scale, the DL community should strive to become more visible, valuable, and approachable to the DH community; and even better, become part of it.\\nOriginality/value\\n– This paper examines both DH and DL fields critically and connects the two communities by discovering gaps and commonalities. Based on the findings, the authors recommend roles and actions to be taken by LIS professionals, libraries, and the DL community. This paper is valuable to both humanities scholars who are seeking support in their research using digital methods and LIS professionals who are interested in providing more effective and suitable services. The paper also helps library administrators and aspiring librarians better understand the concept of DH and grasp insight on the present and future of DH librarianship.', 'Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how scholars in the digital humanities employ information visualization techniques in their research, and how academic librarians should prepare themselves to support this emerging trend. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a content analysis methodology, which further draws techniques from data mining, natural language processing and information visualization to analyze three peer-reviewed journals published within the last five years and ten online university library research guides in this field. Findings To successfully support and effectively contribute to the digital humanities, academic librarians should be knowledgeable in more than just visualization concepts and tools. The content analysis results for the digital humanities journals reflect the importance of recognizing the wide variety of applications and purposes of information visualization in digital humanities research. Practical implications This study provides useful and actionable insights into how academic librarians can prepare for this emerging technology to support future endeavors in the digital humanities. Originality/value Although information visualization has been widely adopted in digital humanities research, it remains unclear how librarians, especially academic librarians who support digital humanities research, should prepare for this emerging technology. This research is the first study to address this research gap through the lens of actual applications of information visualization techniques in digital humanities research, which is compared against university LibGuides for digital humanities research.', 'PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to propose a knowledge extraction framework to extract knowledge, including entities and relationships between them, from unstructured texts in digital humanities (DH).Design/methodology/approachThe proposed cooperative crowdsourcing framework (CCF) uses both human–computer cooperation and crowdsourcing to achieve high-quality and scalable knowledge extraction. CCF integrates active learning with a novel category-based crowdsourcing mechanism to facilitate domain experts labeling and verifying extracted knowledge.FindingsThe case study shows that CCF can effectively and efficiently extract knowledge from multi-sourced heterogeneous data in the field of Tang poetry. Specifically, CCF achieves higher accuracy of knowledge extraction than the state-of-the-art methods, the contribution of feedbacks to the training model can be maximized by the active learning mechanism and the proposed category-based crowdsourcing mechanism can scale up the effective human–computer collaboration by considering the specialization of workers in different categories of tasks.Research limitations/implicationsThis research proposes CCF to enable high-quality and scalable knowledge extraction in the field of Tang poetry. CCF can be generalized to other fields of DH by introducing domain knowledge and experts.Practical implicationsThe extracted knowledge is machine-understandable and can support the research of Tang poetry and knowledge-driven intelligent applications in DH.Originality/valueCCF is the first human-in-the-loop knowledge extraction framework that integrates active learning and crowdsourcing mechanisms; he human–computer cooperation method uses the feedback of domain experts through the active learning mechanism; the category-based crowdsourcing mechanism considers the matching of categories of DH data and especially of domain experts.', 'Unknown', 'The digital collections of newspapers have given rise to a growing interest in studying them with computational methods. This article contributes to this discussion by presenting a method for detecting text reuse in a large corpus of digitized texts. Empirically, the article is based on the corpus of newspapers and journals from the collection of the National Library of Finland. Often, digitized repositories offer only partial views of what actually was published in printed form. The Finnish collection is unique, however, since it covers all published issues up to the year 1920. This article has a two-fold objective: methodologically, it explores how computational methods can be developed so that text reuse can be effectively identified; empirically, the article concentrates on how the circulation of texts developed in Finland from the late eighteenth century to the early twentieth century and what this reveals about the transformation of public discourse in Finland. According to our results, the reuse of texts was an integral part of the press throughout the studied period, which, on the other hand, was part of a wider transnational practice.', 'In this essay, we detail the pedagogical collaboration between a digital humanities librarian, a professor of music and digital media, and a second-year music student that took the form of a design sprint. The product of the design sprint was the Mapping Sentiments through Music (MStM) application. Using this project as a case study, we argue that both digital humanities and music education share a commonality: both disciplines can incorporate elements of design thinking to be successful. As a result, our efforts center direct experimentation with a team, and foster design thinking by promoting descriptive exchange, creative problem solving, and the creation of emergent rather than explicitly delimited meanings. We conclude with several remarks on overlaps between music and design pedagogy, and on librarian-faculty collaborations.', 'Unknown', 'The development of Information Technology and Digital Humanities has brought numerous significant changes to the Cultural Heritage domain. The Digital Humanities has become a dynamic and fertile research field, and new projects and opportunities are constantly flourishing. The BYZART project perfectly fits this context. This project is coordinated by the Department of History and Cultures of the University of Bologna, embracing a wide consortium of partners from Bulgaria, Greece and Italy. It aims at enhancing Byzantine and Post-Byzantine artistic and cultural heritage within the Europeana\\xa0platform. This project will enrich the existing Europeanacollections with about 75,000 new cultural and artistic multimedia objects relevant to Byzantine history and culture, including collections of digitized photos, video and audio content, and 3-D surveys and reconstructions. We have also established a liaison between the new materials and Byzantine-related content already existing on Europeana. The archival material collected and digitized by the BYZART consortium is of the greatest cultural and art-historical importance, but until now, it has not been properly evaluated or published. For this reason, BYZART aims to guarantee the preservation and evaluation of significant cultural heritage objects from a wide range of contexts, while also making them accessible to scholarly and general audiences alike.', 'The editor makes available the accompanying raw data files or high-definition visualizations (however, the links to the downloadable resources seem only to be visible via the EPub version, not the PDF). Because the book stemmed from a series of workshops, it is now part of an ongoing interdisciplinary conversation. Christopher J.

A flurry of books appeared, and AHHE produced two special issues, Digital humanities, digital futures and The necessity of the humanities, in which scholars discuss the value and practice of the humanities in a world that is increasingly digital. This current piece muses on some aspects of the humanities and the digital humanities against a background of the world financial decline, emerging media and new attitudes in society to art, culture, humanities and education.', 'The commentaries by Baldwin (2018), Green (2018), and Porter (2018) on the 2 articles (Burman, 2018; Flis & Van Eck, 2018) in this special section provide a unique perspective on digital humanities approaches to history of psychology. Each of the commentators approached the topic through their own lens-Melinda Baldwin as a historian of scientific journals, Christopher Green as a pioneer in digital history of psychology, and Ted Porter as a historian of quantification. In my response, I tried to reply to the 3 comments by critically discussing 4 themes the special section has raised: the relationship between digital history and conventional history, the perspective that takes databases as both sources for historians and objects in history, the relationship between \"thick descriptions\" and \"thin\" digital ones, and finally, the role of digital history as a type of a \"trading creole\" between scientists working in quantified disciplines like scientific psychology and less quantified ones like history. I think the commentators have rightly observed some pitfalls in the uncritical application of digital history. On the other hand, in my response, I argue that the careful use of digital methods, where the user stays in communication with nondigital historians, opens new perspectives for historians of science, historians of psychology, and psychologists themselves. Digital methods are not there to supplant historicist work but to add to it and translate it to new audiences.', 'Digital humanities is an important challenge for more traditional humanities disciplines to take on, but advanced digital methods for analysis are not often used to answer concrete research questions in these disciplines. This article makes use of extensive digital collections of historical newspapers to discuss the promising, yet challenging relationship between digital humanities and historical research. The search for long-term patterns in digital historical research appropriately positions itself within previous approaches to historical research, but the digitization of sources presents many practical and theoretical questions and obstacles. For this reason, any digital source used in historical research should be critically reviewed beforehand. Digital newspaper research raises new issues and presents new possibilities to better answer traditional questions.', \"This article describes an online laboratory for computational text analysis of Galileo's correspondence, published works, and materials in his library. This Digital Humanities project incorporates newly designed tools informed by research priorities of early modern scholars as well as the literary and scientific practices of the period. As a result, GaLiLeO: Galileo's Library and Letters Online offers a way to understand the contributions of Italian Studies to the shaping of Digital Humanities methods and areas of inquiry with particular emphasis on database design and that analysis of incomplete data.\", 'Unknown', 'Abstract Most commentators locate the origin of digital humanities (DH) in computational text analysis of the mid-twentieth century, beginning in 1946 with Roberto Busa’s plans for the Index Thomisticus, a massive attempt to encode nearly 11 million words of Thomas Aquinas’ writings on IBM punch cards. This event (and the narrative that follows) is found throughout the literature, leading some to believe that early DH work ‘concentrated, perhaps somewhat narrowly, on text analysis (such as classification systems, mark-up, text encoding, and scholarly editing)’ (Presner, 2010, p. 6). Others seem convinced that DH is still only text analysis or too dominated by it (Meeks, 2013)—and misguided in its approach (Fish, 2012). Meanwhile, Underwood (2017) has recently made a case for disentangling distant reading methods from DH generally, noting that the former predates and does not depend on digital technology. This article presents an empirical perspective on the early history of DH by tracing publications in two foundational journals (Computers and the Humanities (CHum), established in 1966, and Literary and Linguistic Computing (LLC), established in 1986), with particular emphasis on media types, authors’ disciplines and locations, and teaching and learning. In doing so, we examine the extent to which early DH work focused on text analysis as well as broader trends in the early history of the field.', 'Abstract\\nIn recent years, historians have reassessed the political importance of the third Home Rule Bill. Important works by G. K. Peatling, Daniel Jackson, and David Thackeray have overturned the once-dominant view that the measure was a straightforward distraction from social reform. Yet, this scholarship has focused almost exclusively on the response of Unionists to Home Rule, and few works discuss the measure’s significance for Edwardian Liberals. This article rectifies this historiographical oversight by comparing the Liberal and Unionist response to the third Home Rule Bill in Devonshire and Lancashire. Using techniques from the digital humanities, I have shown that the measure dominated the grassroots political discourse of both parties before the First World War.', 'The past decade has seen huge growth in the teaching and research of what is broadly called digital humanities (DH). Increases in computing power and data availability have seen a rise in individual researchers and research groups working on digital scholarship projects in the humanities, arts and social sciences. This article shows how publishers of traditional digital archives have adapted to the increasing prevalence of DH amongst their traditional customers. The success of this adaptation depends entirely on the relationship with the academic community, and Gale has seen a shift from being a provider of products to a partner, trusted to help libraries, scholars and institutions achieve their objectives. As a leading global provider of digital archives, Gale is well placed to review the current state of DH research and teaching, and this article will discuss significant academic events that have brought scholars, librarians and students together, and the lessons learned for institutions around the world looking to expand into DH. Finally, the article looks at how working to understand the common challenges and barriers to DH research and teaching has pushed many archive publishers to re-evaluate traditional archive publishing and enable new and innovative ways to explore the past. Keywords: Digital humanities, Gale, digital archives, primary sources, libraries, academic publishing', 'In spite of the increasingly large textual datasets humanities researchers are confronted with, and the need for automatic tools to extract information from them, we observe a lack of communication and diverging goals between the communities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Humanities (DH). This contrasts with the wealth of potential opportunities that could arise from closer collaborations. We argue that more efforts are needed to make NLP tools work for DH datasets so that that NLP research applied to humanities data receives more attention, leading to the development of evaluation approaches tailored towards relevant research questions. This has the potential to bring methodological advances to NLP, while at the same time confronting DH datasets with powerful state-of-the-art techniques.', 'This paper addresses the relationship between Digital Libraries (DL) and Digital Humanities (DH) with a special focus on global access to knowledge. An overview DL & DH and their interconnections are described. This is followed by an overview of what the humanities need from a global networked infrastructure involving Digital libraries: in other words, what can Digital Humanities learn from Libraries? Conversely, how can Libraries be DH-Friendly? To conclude we propose some research orientations that emerged from comparing DL and DH agendas, and we outline the challenges that still lay ahead. Review paper on the State of the art of Libraries and Digital Humanities. What do the humanities need from a globally networked infrastructure involving Digital libraries? What can Digital Humanities learn from Libraries? What would a DH-friendly Library involve? What are the core elements and activities that would be involving both? The challenges facing both Digital Libraries and Digital Humanities are discussed and some elements on future directions are outlined.', 'Automated computer vision methods and tools offer new ways of analysing audio-visual material in the realm of the Digital Humanities (DH). While there are some promising results where these tools can be applied, there are basic challenges, such as algorithmic bias and the lack of sufficient transparency, one needs to carefully use these tools in a productive and responsible way. When it comes to the socio-technical understanding of computer vision tools and methods, a major unit of sociological analysis, attentiveness, and access for configuration (for both computer vision scientists and DH scholars) is what computer science calls “ground truth”. What is specified in the ground truth is the template or rule to follow, e.g. what an object looks like. This article aims at providing scholars in the DH with knowledge about how automated tools for image analysis work and how they are constructed. Based on these insights, the paper introduces an approach called “active learning” that can help to configure these tools in ways that fit the specific requirements and research questions of the DH in a more adaptive and user-centered way. We argue that both objectives need to be addressed, as this is, by all means, necessary for a successful implementation of computer vision tools in the DH and related fields.', \"In 2018, the University of Wollongong (UOW) launched The Future-Ready Library strategy. The inevitable question arose: How does one become 'future-ready'? The answer lies, in part, in proactively engaging with evolving technologies and improving individual staff digital dexterities. Coinciding with release of The Future-Ready Library strategy, the Digital Literacy Workplace Program was put in place to foster upskilling opportunities for Library staff. One of the outcomes of this program was the creation of a local Digital Humanities Community of Practice in 2018. This article focuses on the transformative journey of the Community of Practice in developing staff digital dexterity through the completion of mini projects. These mini projects incorporated both hard and soft skillsets to develop agile, future-focused, T-shaped professionals. While initially directed at developing digital dexterity and increased knowledge of the Digital Humanities, the Community of Practice recognized the need for adoption of a broader, more strategic approach, to support clients and staff in this area. This resulted in the launch of the Digital Scholarship Strategy project in 2020. The project group was tasked with scoping the feasibility of initiating a Library-led roll-out across the organization, or a tighter focused implementation within the UOW Library operational environment. The expedited move to online teaching and learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the timeliness and applicability of these initiatives.\"]\n"
